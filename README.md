New Studio

This project is a graphical interactive interface that works with openGL
User can move the cube and the flame is taking pixel meshes from webcam live.
I'm modifying a library that I got from here:
https://github.com/kylemcdonald/openFrameworksDemos/tree/master/ColorCube
the original library is not interactive, and also doesn't have the visual beauties! :)
